This code uses Partial Linearised Density matrix (PLDM) to compute the linear and nonlinear spectra of
a given diabetic Hamiltonian. The basic PLDM structure of PLDM code is adapted from Arkajit Mandal's 
Semiclassical NAMD repository (https://github.com/arkajitmandal/SemiClassical-NAMD) and the code is modified for spectroscopy calculations.
