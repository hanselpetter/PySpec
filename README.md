# PySpec

PySpec is a python based code for simulating linear and multi-dimensional spectroscopy for a given Diabatic 
Hamiltonian. The dynamics for the quantum subsystem under a given bath is done currently being done by 
focused-PLDM and this code is basically adapted from [Arkajit Mandal's code](https://github.com/arkajitmandal/SemiClassical-NAMD).
